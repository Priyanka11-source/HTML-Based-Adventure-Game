# HTML-Based-Adventure-Game
Create a simple "Choose Your Own Adventure" story. This sounds complex, but it's just a clever way of linking multiple HTML pages together. For this project, you need multiple files. Create three separate HTML files in the same folder with the names index.html, forest.html, and cave.html.
